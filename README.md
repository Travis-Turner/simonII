////////////////SIMON II////////////////

This is my version of the classic Milton 
Bradley game, 'Simon'.  

I started this project based off of a 
challenge outlined on FreeCodeCamp,
but it has grown a bit beyond the terms 
originally given in that challenge, 
although it still meets them.

////////////////////////////////////////

The game features 4 modes of play.
 
 *Normal Speed with retries
 *Ultra Speed with retries
 *Normal speed with no retries
 *Ultra speed with no retries
 
I consider the last mode to be the true mode
of play.

//////////////////////////////////////////

Also worth noting is that I created all the
sound assets myself.  I also did the voice
over.  I integrated this with the JS
library Howler.

//////////////////////////////////////////

I built the application using the React 
framework.  I did not integrate Redux into
this project, as the scale was intended
to remain small.

//////////////////////////////////////////

The game also saves two high scores to the 
browser's localStorage mechanism.
